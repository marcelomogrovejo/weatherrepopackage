    A simple repository package project which is a persistence layer to ToDoMVP and ToDoSwiftUI projects.
  </p>
</p>

# Description
<p>ToDoRepository package is a simple swift package which is developed to learn 'Swift Package Manager' and 'Repository Pattern'.<br>
The project consists of an API Service which exposes methods to fetch, create, delete and edit a task among others. And a data source which can be whatever source of data like UserDefaults or a remote database.</p>

# Getting started
<p>
1. Make sure you have the Xcode version 14.0 or above installed on your computer.<br>
2. Download the ToDoMVP and/or ToDoSwiftUI projects files from the repository.<br>
3. Open the ToDoMVP and/or ToDoSwiftUI projects files in Xcode.<br>
4. Make sure the TodoRepositoryPackage, PetShopAnimationPackage and Lottie Swift Packages are downloaded successfully.<br>
5. Run the active scheme.<br>

You should see a lottie animation on the screen.<br>
You should see a main button that takes you to an empty list of tasks.<br>

# Structure 
* "DataSource": Procotols, error handling and model files.
* "DomainLayer": Api service file that exposes the methods to be used by the apps.

# Running the tests
<p>The ToDoRepository package project can be tested using the built-in framework XCTest.<br>
To start testing the project, you will need to change to the 'ToDoRepository packageTests' target in your Xcode project, and then just run the tests project.</p>

# Deployment
Keep in mind that deploying an iOS app to the App Store requires having an Apple Developer account.

1. Click on the "Product" menu in Xcode and select "Archive." This will create an archive of your project.
2. Once the archive has been created, select it in the Organizer window and click on the "Validate" button to perform some preliminary tests on the app.
3. Once validation is complete, click on the "Distribute" button and select "Ad Hoc" or "App Store" distribution. 
This will create a signed IPA file that can be installed on iOS devices.
4. Follow the prompts in the distribution wizard to complete the distribution process.
5. Once the distribution is complete, you can use the IPA file to install the app on iOS devices
